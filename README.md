Chrome Mobile Web App
=========

This repo contains a Chrome mobile web application.  It is a demonstration for a talk I gave at AnDevCon in Boston in May 2014.  The presentation is at:
https://github.com/rschwager/andevcon-sample/blob/master/slides/andevcon-rschwager.pptx?raw=true

The app demonstrates some of the challenges of loading external content in a Chrome App.  I demonstrate three ways to do it:

  - Using the < webview > tag supported on the desktop 
  - Using an XmlHttpRequest to load content externally and then converting all the images to inline images.
  - Using a sandbox to fetch and display the content.

This was born out of a hackathon that happened at Millennial Media with Elena Hearty and TJ Kirchner.  We wrote up a blog entry on our project.  That can be found at: http://www.millennialmedia.com/blog/2014/03/addressing-google-chrome-web-apps/.
